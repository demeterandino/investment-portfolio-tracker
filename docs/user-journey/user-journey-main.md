# User Journey — Automated Investor (Primary Persona)

## Stage 1: Onboarding
- User connects portfolio (CSV import or API)
- System auto-categorizes assets
- User selects risk profile (Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive)

**Pain Points:**  
Manual categorization, unclear risk tolerance setup

**Opportunities:**  
AI-assisted onboarding suggestions


## Stage 2: Portfolio Overview
- User sees asset allocation
- Gains insights on diversification, sectors, regions
- Sees automation readiness score (new metric)

**Pain Points:**  
Too much raw data

**Opportunities:**  
Show only insights that matter (e.g. “3 assets overweight”)


## Stage 3: Daily Monitoring
- Automated alerts highlight relevant movements
- Alerts are grouped to avoid noise
- User gets explanations: “WHY this alert matters”

**Pain Points:**  
Other apps send irrelevant notifications

**Opportunities:**  
Precision alert engine


## Stage 4: Automation Engine
- System suggests rebalancing with projected impact
- User approves or adjusts recommendation
- System explains rebalancing logic:
  “This reduces risk by 12%, improves diversification”

**Pain Points:**  
Understanding the impact of rebalancing

**Opportunities:**  
Clear, user-focused explanations


## Stage 5: Long-Term Review
- Monthly automation report
- Score improvements (risk ↓, diversification ↑)
- Summary: “How automation improved your portfolio this month”

**Pain Points:**  
No long-term visibility

**Opportunities:**  
Gamified automation score and progress tracking
