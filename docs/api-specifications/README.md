# API Specifications

This folder contains high-level API specifications for the Investment Portfolio Tracker.

The goal is to describe **what** the main REST endpoints do, so that developers can understand how the frontend and backend would communicate.

## Structure

- `portfolio-api.md` — portfolio and asset-related endpoints  
- `alerts-api.md` — alert listing, filtering, and acknowledgement  
- `rebalancing-api.md` — simulation and execution of rebalancing  

All examples assume a base URL like:

`https://api.example.com/api/v1`
