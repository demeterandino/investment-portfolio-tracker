## Note on Prototyping
All clickable paths, transitions, and branching logic are maintained **directly in Figma**, not here in the repo.

The MD file serves only as:
- a documentation index  
- a readable overview  


## Next Steps
- Upload flow screenshots (optional)  
- Update Figma link when adding interactions  
- Add flow-specific comments in GitHub Issues when relevant
