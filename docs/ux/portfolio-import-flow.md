# User Flow — Portfolio Import

## Goal
Show how the user imports their portfolio into the system.

## Steps
1. User navigates to Portfolio Import
2. User uploads CSV or connects brokerage
3. System validates structure
4. Auto-Categorization runs
5. User sees confirmation summary
6. User continues to dashboard

## Notes
- Auto-categorization is triggered automatically (Epic 1: Asset Categorization)
- Validation failure returns the user to Step 3
